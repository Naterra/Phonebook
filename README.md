This app was build as a part of drupal website. They keep using php on backend and wish to rewrite frontend with React.js.

So, lets call it LAMR stack.

#### Tasks was solved:
 * React.js App under subfolder
 * Redux-forms
 * Webpack for production & developement. ENV vars.
 * Paging
 * Search box
 * Modals
 * Redux Dev Tools
 
 #### Note
 There is no create-react-app cli, so webpack configs is in your hand.
